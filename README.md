## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML and CSS, for structure and input ID's only. The work is all on JavaScript. It starts considering all elements from HTML & CSS were loaded with the Event Listener 'load'. It was a total of four functions for the overall code (units, tens, hundreds, and exceptions), with that and the use of an Array Method's .split(''), I could wrap all the pattern and decisions to code it.

## Optimizations

If I had more time, I would do ti using OOP and make less repetitive and more readable.

## Lessons Learned:

It was a challenge at the first how to wrap and how to use _if statements_ to evaluate the decisions. Developing all the logic gave me chills, since I could do it by myself.
